The [Thousand Island Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiandao_Lake) lies at 29°22′ to
29°50′ N, 118°34′ to 119°15′ E and is a large artificial reservoir in
western Zhejiang Province, China. It was created in 1959 by the
construction of the Xinanjiang dam on the Xinanjiang River for
hydroelectricity. Flooding approximately 580 km2, it formed 1078 islands
with areas \> 0.25 ha when the water reached its highest level (108 m).
The vegetation type on the islands is natural secondary forest, mainly
of *Pinus massoniana*, with many broadleaved trees and shrubs mixed,
including *Cyclobalanopsis glauca*, *Castanopsis sclerophylla*, *Smilax
davidiana*, *Grewia biloba* and *Loropetalum chinense*. The climate is a
typical subtropical monsoon zone and is strongly seasonal.
