Welcome to my homepage! I am [Xingfeng Si](/ "Xingfeng Si"), a PhD candidate in animal ecology at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn "Zhejiang University"), China. Generally, my research interest lies in island biogeography, community ecology, conservation biology and ornithology. 

I started my researches of bird communities since 2008 on fragmented islands of the [Thousand Island Lake](/pages/en/thousand-island-lake/ "Thousand Islang Lake") (TIL), China. TIL is a large inundated reservoir with 1078 islands which was created in 1959 by the construction of Xin'anjiang Dam. It is a perfect land-bridge system to test the MacArthur & Wilson's theory of island biogeography. I used the long-term counts of breeding bird communities on a set of islands to quantify the colonization-extinction dynamics of the theory, and to test the alternative hypothesizes that "target" and "rescue" effects will lead to different patterns of colonization and extinction. In additions to the bird studies, I used the occupancy data of lizards and small mammals  to unveil the biogeographical patterns of beta diversity, which will provide more detail into the biodiversity conservation on fragmented islands. 

Camera trapping of wildlife, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals, had been practiced and become an available method to estimate the abundance of animals. I started the studies of bird and mammal communities during 2009 - 2012  in [Gutianshan Reserve](/pages/en/gutianshan-reserve/ "Gutianshan Reserve"), China, to estimate the animal population adjusted with detectability using camera traps. Associated with the bird survey using territory mapping in a permanent plot in the reserve, I assess how the environmental factors influence the distribution of bird communities. 

Besides the academic researches, I like reading, traveling and cycling. One of my important dream is the long travel from Chengdu to Lhasa (the capital of Tibet) by bike. I would plan to spend one month to complete this 2200-km journey. I initialed with this dream eight years ago when I was an undergraduate, while I am always waiting for the right time to make my dream come true, because it is a great chance to enjoy the unique landscape and biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I am also a [postcrossser](http://www.postcrossing.com/user/Xingfeng "Postcrossing"), please feel free to [contact me](/en/about) if you have an interest to swap postcards with me.


您好，欢迎访问[斯幸峰](/ "Xingfeng Si")的个人网站。现在我面临着三大问题：

1. 什么时候博士毕业？
2. 论文发了没有？
3. 工作找到了吗？

我以先声夺人昂首挺胸势权且做统一回答：

1. 理论上2014年毕业；
2. 论文难产；
3. 待就业。

若有后续问题，[留言板](/cn/guestbook)热烈欢迎您的一切留言。

鄙人上得了山，下得了湖，爬得了树，游得了水。出身乡野，寒窗二十余载，历经小学、初中、高中、本科和研究生五个阶段，读书年限与距老家距离呈显著性正相关(r=0.84,t=3.06,df=4,p=0.038)。很惭愧，没有正式上过幼儿园，传闻入园不久由于不遵守相关法律法规而被老师遣送回家(此处因年代久远已不可考)，故上小学后读了两站一年级。二十年后，就读于[三墩职校](http://www.zju.edu.cn)，食性稍变，从专蛀书本到啃噬文献(xián)。目前，鄙人专职在[千岛湖](/pages/cn/thousand-island-lake/)搞鸟，兼职在[古田山](/pages/cn/gutianshan-reserve/)搞兽，正所谓禽兽通吃。鸟，是岛上的林中鸟。好鸟：秧鸡翠鸟我不管，鸳鸯鸻鹬任其乱。麻雀杜鹃年年记，拓殖灭绝被片段。兽，是山中的地栖兽。好兽：一团两团三四团，猪獾狗獾加鼬獾。黑麂黄麂满山兽，昼夜监测密度算。

至今，网购愈500本书，买的速度比看得快；会打7种球，但都不精通；跑了两次全马，都是卡着5小时关门点；单车骑行近2万里，幸好2013年底原装链条光荣退役。
