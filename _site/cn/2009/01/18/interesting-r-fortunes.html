<p>标题流俗一下，内容来自于R的fortunes包——关于R的语录。前些日子把每一条都看了一遍，现摘录个人认为比较搞笑的部分语录于此。从中可以体会到大家对SAS的Type III Sum of Squares的一致否定态度（隔三差五拿它开玩笑）；没想到Paul Murrell也是很幽默的人；(Brian) Ripley就像R-help的网管一样，其姓已变成了动词（其功效和我天朝的“和谐”有一拼）；Uwe Ligges就像版主一样拼命移帖、删帖，有时还要抱怨一番……玩笑是玩笑，里面也有很多值得学习的地方：</p>

<p>-- Brian D. Ripley</p>

<p>I was profoundly disappointed when I saw that S-PLUS 4.5 now provides "Type III" sums of squares as a routine option for the</p>

<p>summary method for aov objects. I note that it is not yet available for multistratum models, although this has all the</p>

<p>hallmarks of an oversight (that is, a bug) rather than common sense seeing the light of day. When the decision was being</p>

<p>taken of whether to include this feature, "because the FDA requires it" a few of my colleagues and I were consulted and our</p>

<p>reply was unhesitatingly a clear and unequivocal "No", but it seems the FDA and SAS speak louder and we were clearly outvoted.</p>

<p>R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running</p>

<p>You must realize that R is written by experts in statistics and statistical computing who, despite popular opinion, do not</p>

<p>the days of punched cards and magnetic tape when fitting a single linear model may take several days because your first 5</p>

<p>attempts failed due to syntax errors in the JCL or the SAS code, still reflect the approach of "give me every possible</p>

<p>statistic that could be calculated from this model, whether or not it makes sense". The approach taken in R is different. The</p>
