<p>这首歌还挺好听的，小子我今晚就听着这首歌写下了“统计之都”的<a href="http://cos.name/about/">关于页面</a>。顺便发布一下通知，统计之都自今日起全面转型（访问<a href="http://cos.name">新的统计之都网站</a>），我在两年多前的“博客+论坛”结构终于出现在人世间了，另外还加上了维基。从现在起，要真正开始广邀天下统计英雄共同建设这座都城了。</p>

<blockquote><p>I had a dream
Strange it may seems
It was my perfect day</p></blockquote>

<p>Open my eyes
I realize
This is my perfect day</p>

<p>Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old</p>

<p>Do-do-do-do</p>

<p>Birds in the sky
They look so high
This is my perfect day</p>

<p>I feel the breeze
I feel it is
It is my perfect day</p>

<p>Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old
Hope you never grow old</p>

<p>Forever young
I hope you stay
Forever young
Do-do-do-do</p>
