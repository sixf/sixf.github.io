<p>The world has changed. You can feel it on <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr">GitHub</a>. You can smell it on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109653178371807724268/posts">Google+</a>. The <strong>knitr</strong> package, as an alternative tool to Sweave, has features that you have been longing for, and features that you might have never imagined. Thumb through <a href="https://github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-manual.pdf">the PDF manual</a> to see some of them.</p>

<p>Currently this package is still a beta version, so I'm looking for feedback from early birds on:</p>

<ol>
<li>is the PDF documentation confusing in any places? e.g. you have no idea on how to install the package because it was not mentioned in the manual;</li>
<li>does <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr">the website</a> look ugly in your browser? (I know it does with IE under Windows) I used a font from Google Font API, and it does not seem to be consistent across different web browsers/OS'es;</li>
<li>what kind of difficulties did you have in switching from Sweave/pgfSweave/whatever-Sweave to <strong>knitr</strong>?</li>
<li>do you like the idea of putting R code/output in a shaded frame in LaTeX? is the default shading (<code>rgb(.97, .97, .97)</code>) too dark or too light? how about the highlighting theme?</li>
<li>have you ever tried to hack at Sweave? I'd love to listen to your stories;</li>
<li>what else do you expect from <strong>knitr</strong>?</li>
</ol>


<p>Feel free to file a bug report in <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues">the Issues page</a> if you find any problems or have any suggestions. I appreciate your efforts in making this <strong>knitr</strong> package even neater!</p>
