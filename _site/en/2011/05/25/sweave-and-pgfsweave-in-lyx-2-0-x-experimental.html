<p>Please ignore this post completely, because Sweave support has become mature in LyX since 2.0.2, and I no longer plan to add the pgfSweave module in LyX. For pgfSweave users, you may consider the new <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/lyx/">knitr module</a> (available since 2.0.3) which uses the R package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr">knitr</a>.</p>
