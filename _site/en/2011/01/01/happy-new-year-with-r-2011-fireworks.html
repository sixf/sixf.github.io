<p>Last year I posted an animation created in R to celebrate the new year, and this year I've got a more fabulous animation (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation">available on CRAN</a>)</p>

<p>The above animation comes from the <code>demo('fireworks')</code> in the R package <code>animation</code> 2.0-0. Thanks for the contribution of Weicheng Zhu.</p>

<p>Another demo I did not mention on this Christmas was <code>demo('Xmas2')</code>:</p>

<p>Thanks for the contribution of Jing Jiao.</p>

<p>There are a whole bunch of new features in the <code>animation</code> package v2.0-0 (this version is a milestone); please just go and check out them by yourself.</p>
