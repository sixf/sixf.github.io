<p>You can know more about me in the <a href="/">homepage</a> and my <a href="../vitae/">vitae</a>. This blog site, as its name indicates, is about statistics, R, graphics and fun. It is particularly focused on R. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please do not take everything for granted.</p>

<p>This site was created with <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and the template was derived from the site <a href="http://lhzhang.com/">setImpl</a> by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of <a href="http://ztpala.com/">Tao Zhang</a> (thanks a lot, guys!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (<code>&lt;-</code>) or next post by right-arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>), or equivalently keys <code>J</code> and <code>K</code>.</p>

<p>I like contributing to open source software like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>: I'm the author of a few R packages (see <a href="../vitae/">vitae</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>: I maintain the Sweave and knitr modules in LyX with Jean-Marc Lasgouttes</li>
</ul>


<p>I have an interview on <a href="http://yihui.xie.usesthis.com">The Setup</a> where you will learn more about me on the software side.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/yihui/">GitHub</a> or Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/xieyihui">@xieyihui</a> or <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109653178371807724268/posts">Google+</a>.
