<p>Tal Galili <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/14660969/559676">asked</a> a question on StackOverflow on publishing blog posts to WordPress from R + <strong>knitr</strong>. William K. Morris has written <a href="http://wkmor1.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/rchievement-of-the-day-3-bloggin-from-r-14/">a solution</a> long time ago, and I tweaked it a little bit and created a function <code>knit2wp()</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr">development version</a> of <strong>knitr</strong>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/wordpress/">page for WordPress</a> in the <strong>knitr</strong> website for details. Below is a sample screenshot:</p>

<p>P.S. I meant to write a separate post about this, but I probably will not find time -- in case you have not <a href="http://lists.stat.ucla.edu/pipermail/jss-announce/2013-January/000377.html">noticed</a>, the <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/">Journal of Statistical Software</a> ranked the first recently in terms of the impact factor in the category of "Statistics &amp; Probability":</p>

<p>Although everybody agrees the impact factor is nonsense, I think this is still an indication of the impact of open-access journals. If I cannot read the full content of a paper from my Google search, I will not bother to read it at all. No, I'm lazy and I will not go the library.</p>
