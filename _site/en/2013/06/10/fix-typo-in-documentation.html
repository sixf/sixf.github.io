<p>So I just got yet yet another
<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/sweave/#comment-924948061">comment</a> saying
"you have a typo in your documentation". While I do appreciate these kind
reminders, I think it might be a good exercise for those who want to try GIT
and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Github pull
requests</a>, which make
it possible for you to contribute to open source and fix obvious problems
<em>with no questions being asked</em> -- just do it yourself, and send the changes
to the original author(s) through Github.</p>

<p>The official documentation for Github pull requests is a little bit verbose
for beginners. Basically what you need to do for simple tasks are:</p>

<ol>
<li>click the <code>Fork</code> button and clone the repository in your own account;</li>
<li>make the changes in your cloned version;</li>
<li>push to your repository;</li>
<li>click the <code>Pull Request</code> button to send a request to the original author;</li>
</ol>


<p>For trivial changes, sometimes I accept them on my cell phone while I'm
still in bed. No extra communication is needed.</p>

<p>Occasionally I see reports of this kind of trivial documentation changes in
the R-devel mailing list, and I believe that is just horribly inefficient.
You could have done this quietly and quickly, and the developers could have
merged the changes with a single mouse click. (Oh, okay, well, you know,
SVN, mailing lists, ...)</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr"><strong>knitr</strong> repository</a>, it has two
branches: <code>master</code> and <code>gh-pages</code>. The R package lives in the <code>master</code>
branch, and the <strong>knitr</strong> website lives in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. If you
want to fix any problems in the website, just check out the <code>gh-pages</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>All pages were written in Markdown, so edit them with your favorite text
editor. For example, as the above comment pointed out, I omitted a right
parenthesis <code>)</code> in <code>_posts/2012-02-24-sweave.md</code>, and you just add it, save
the file, write a GIT commit message, push to your repository and send the
pull request.</p>

<p>I know I can do this by myself in five seconds, and it takes me way more
time to write this blog post, but I just want everybody to know how people
with different skill levels can play their roles in software development.</p>

<p>Let's see how many minutes it takes for the pull request to come after I
publish this blog post. Hurry!! :)</p>
