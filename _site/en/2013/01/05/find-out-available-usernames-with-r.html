<blockquote><p>Update on 2013/01/05: Xiao Nan in the comments pointed out that <code>apply(combn(letters, 2), 2, paste0, collapse = '')</code> was wrong for all two-letter usernames, and indeed it was. It is not a combination problem. Now I use his elegant <code>outer()</code> solution. One can also use <code>expand.grid(letters, letters)</code>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Github <a href="https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads">decided</a> to take off their downloads service, and I was very unhappy with this decision. This means I have to migrate several files to other places, and update links accordingly. I saw <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> still provides the service, so I want to migrate my files there.</p>

<p>Sadly my name <code>yihui</code> was already taken on Bitbucket, so I hoped I could get a short name, which made me think how I could check the availability of a username via programming, and here was my solution with the <strong>RCurl</strong> package:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="r">library<span class="p">(</span>RCurl<span class="p">)</span>
test_user <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kr">function</span><span class="p">(</span>site <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;https://bitbucket.org/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                     candidates <span class="o">=</span> c<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">9</span><span class="p">,</span> letters<span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kr">for</span> <span class="p">(</span>i <span class="kr">in</span> candidates<span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kr">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span>url.exists<span class="p">(</span>paste0<span class="p">(</span>site<span class="p">,</span> i<span class="p">)))</span> message<span class="p">(</span>i<span class="p">)</span>
    Sys.sleep<span class="p">(</span>runif<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">.1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1"># be nice</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1"># examples</span>
test_user<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="c1"># two-letter names</span>
test_user<span class="p">(</span>candidates <span class="o">=</span> as.vector<span class="p">(</span>outer<span class="p">(</span>letters<span class="p">,</span> letters<span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;paste0&#39;</span><span class="p">)))</span>
<span class="c1"># check github</span>
test_user<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;https://github.com/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>As of the time of this blog post, there are no two-letter usernames left on Github, but some are still available on Bitbucket, e.g. <code>by</code> and <code>eq</code>, etc, and the number <code>4</code> is also available.</p>
