<p>Yesterday I have submitted a package called "animation" to CRAN. You may get it from CRAN (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation">http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation</a>).</p>

<p>This package aims at illustrating various statistical methods and data analyses in a form of <em>animation</em>.</p>
