<p>Yesterday I read a quotation from "Quotes of the Day" which by accident expressed a rule for statistical modelling:</p>

<blockquote><p>[...] I never guess. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. (by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is interesting. It just indicated a rule of ethics: be honest and don't alter your data to "fit" your "marvelous" models.</p>
