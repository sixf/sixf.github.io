<p>There are some scholars making research on "indices" this year, and a few of them are my teachers. The day before yesterday I saw there was a press conference about a development index of China, which triggered one of my old ideas on the function of statistics (analysis). I believe two conditions will make the work of statistics meaningless:</p>

<ol>
<li>If we do nothing but just <em>rank</em> our samples; i.e. which is the first, and which is the last...</li>
<li>If our conclusions are common sense; i.e. anybody can know our conclusions <em>without</em> statistical analysis.</li>
</ol>


<p>Unfortunately, what I read from the news seemed to satisfy these two conditions.</p>
