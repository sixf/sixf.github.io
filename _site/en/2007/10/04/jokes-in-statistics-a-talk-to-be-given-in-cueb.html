<p>I'm going to give a talk in the CUEB on some topics in the discipline of statistics at the invitation of the Association of Statistics of CUEB, and I've mainly prepared two topics for them: one is about those jokes from <a href="http://www.ilstu.edu/~gcramsey/Gallery.html">Prof. Gary's gallery of statistics jokes</a>, and the other is about some tools for the research of statistics. Below are materials for this talk:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slides for "<a href="https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/Jokes-2007-Yihui-Xie.pdf">Jokes in Statistics</a>" (English, PDF by LaTeX);</li>
<li>Slides for "<a href="https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/Stat-tools-2007-Yihui-Xie.pdf">A Leisure Look on Some Tools for Statistics</a>" (<em>Chinese</em>, PDF by PowerPoint) and <a href="https://gist.github.com/1756901">code</a>;</li>
