<p>This afternoon I went to the Beijing Custom to give a lecture on sampling techniques as well as my R program. Actually I didn't make any preparations until late in this morning. When I finished my lunch, I made some animated pictures to illustrate these four kinds of sampling methods: simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and systematic sampling.</p>

<p>After I came back to school, I added these animations to my little project <a href="http://animation.yihui.name">Animated Statistics Using R</a>.</p>
