<blockquote><p>NOTE: There's a typo in the graph! The <code>$\mu$</code> should be replaced with the sample mean <code>$\bar{x}$</code>! And the code is available in the R package <strong>animation</strong>; see <code>library(animation); ?conf.int</code></p></blockquote>

<p>Recently I've been thinking about attending the conference of <a href="http://www.iasc-ars.org/IASC2008/index.html">IASC2008</a>, and my vague idea is to use <em>animations</em> in statistical education, especially in the demonstration of some algorithms containing <em>iterations</em> or <em>loops</em>. Perhaps the main difficulty just lies in an integrated theory -- currently I'm still not clear about the literature in this area (if anyone knows, please do drop me a line).</p>

<p>The other day when I was browsing the R documentation pages, I noticed that the amount of materials in those pages is increasing at a high speed. Among them I also saw some excellent web sites built by students (e.g. from Taiwan), which has triggered my own idea on building an independent website introducing animated pictures in statistics.</p>

<p>So... Let's come back to the topic. In fact this is a demonstration I made several weeks ago, and today I modified it a little bit in order that the coverage rate can be better shown. The idea behind this simulation is simple: draw samples (random numbers) from the population which follows <code>N(0, 1)</code>, and calculate confidence intervals (CI) based on these samples respectively. I believe everybody surely knows the formula in the main title of the figure below (suppose <code>sigma</code> is <em>known</em>, then compute the CI for the <em>unknown</em> <code>mu</code>).</p>
