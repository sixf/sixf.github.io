<p>Amber Watkins gave me a suggestion on the animation for the ratio estimation, and I think this is a good topic for my <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation"><strong>animation</strong></a> package. I've finished writing the initial version of the function <code>sample.ratio()</code> for this package, which will appear in the version 1.1-2 a couple of days later.</p>

<p>As we know, the benefit of ratio estimation is that sampling skewness may be  adjusted for, because the estimation of $latex \bar{Y}$ will make use of the information in the relationship of <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>: $latex \bar{X} \cdot (\bar{y}/\bar{x})$. Here is a demo (we can see the ratio estimate, denoted by the red line, generally performs better than $latex \bar{y}$):</p>
