<p>You have been warned above.</p></blockquote>

<p>For a long time I've been wondering why we are not able to use Enter in the LyX Scrap environment which was set up by Gregor Gorjanc for Sweave. Two weeks ago, I (finally!) could not help asking Gregor about this issue, as I'm using ``LyX + Sweave'' more and more in my daily work. He explained it here: <a href="http://ggorjan.blogspot.com/2009/07/lyx-sweave-mandatory-use-of.html">LyX-Sweave: mandatory use of control+enter in code chunks</a></p>

<p>After digging into the LyX customization manual for a while, I found a solution which allows us to press the Enter key just as we normally do when typing in a LyX document. The key is to use <code>Environment</code> instead of <code>paragraph</code> as <code>LatexType</code> for the style definition of <code>Scrap</code>. Besides, I used the <code>LatexName</code> as <code>wrapsweave</code>, as a <code>LatexName</code> is required by LyX. The definition for <code>wrapsweave</code> is simple: just two empty lines by <code>\par</code>. (If you define it as <code>\newenvironment{wrapsweave}{}{}</code>, you will run into troubles sometimes; especially when you use indent for paragraphs.)</p>

<p>As we know, LaTeX environment cannot be centered in LyX (only paragraphs can), so I defined a special environment <code>ScrapCenter</code> when I want to insert graphics via Sweave and make them center-aligned.</p>

<p>To put all efforts together, this is the new <code>literate-scrap.inc</code> (compare it with <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/lyx/literate-scrap.inc">http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/lyx/literate-scrap.inc</a>):</p>

<p>Enjoy pressing a single Enter key in LyX now! :)</p>

<p>P.S. the side effect of this modification is, your R code will be separated by empty lines. But Sweave will remove blank lines by default, so that is not really a big trouble.</p>

<p>P.P.S. Next time I will write my solution of using <code>pgfSweave</code> in LyX -- if you have never tried the <code>pgfSweave</code> package in R, I'd strongly recommend you do it right now!! My comment on this package is: amazingly beautiful!</p>
