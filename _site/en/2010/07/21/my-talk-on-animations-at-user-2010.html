<p>As every useR knows, the useR! 2010 conference is being held at NIST in Gaithersburg these days. I have just finished my talk on the R package <strong>animation</strong> this afternoon. Here are <a href="https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/animation-useR2010-Yihui-Xie.pdf">my slides</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/2166508">R code</a> for those who are interested.</p>

<p>Have fun, even if you are a PhD!</p>
