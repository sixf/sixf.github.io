<p>Auto-completion is fancy in a text editor. Notepad++ does not support auto-completion for the R language, so I spent a couple of hours on creating such an XML file to support R, and you can get <a href="https://gist.github.com/2143971">the R script on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Put the output file <code>R.xml</code> from that script under <code>plugins/APIs</code> in the installation directory of Notepad++ (you can see several other XML files there supporting different languages such as C), and make sure you have enabled auto-completion in Notepad++ (<code>Settings --&gt; Preferences --&gt; Backup/Auto-completion</code>). Open an R script and start typing a familiar function (e.g. <code>paste()</code>), you will see some candidates in a drop-down list like this:</p>

<p>Hit the Enter key if the function name selected in the list is correct for you, then type <code>(</code> and you will see hints for parameters:</p>

<p>The file <code>R.xml</code> contains almost all visible R objects in base R packages as well as recommended packages like <strong>MASS</strong>. You may create an extended XML file (containing keywords from other packages) by yourself after loading the packages you need into your current workspace, and run the R script above.</p>
