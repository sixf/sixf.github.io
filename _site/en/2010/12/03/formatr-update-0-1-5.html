<p>The <strong>formatR</strong> package has been silent for quite a few months now. Recently I've been moving my old packages from R-Forge to GitHub, and I finally killed several things on my TODO list. In the past, I made an awkward decision to let <strong>formatR</strong> depend on the <strong>animation</strong> package, which was ridiculous. Ronggui suggested me remove this dependency long time ago, and now it came true in the new version 0.1-5 (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=formatR">on CRAN now</a>). So <strong>formatR</strong> is finally a standalone package, although you can choose to use the GUI version after installing the <strong>gWidgets</strong> package (see the <code>tidy.gui()</code> function). To work with command lines, <code>tidy.source()</code> can be helpful. It takes a file, formats it into a tidy form, and writes the output into a specified file, or simply to the console.</p>

<p>When I first saw the Pretty-R tool provided by Revolution Analytics, I was not completely satisfied because it is just not "pretty" enough. If they have R and the <strong>formatR</strong> package installed on the server, perhaps they can provide another option to help the users format their source code in a more beautiful way, e.g. they could have turned</p>

<pre><code>x = seq(.1,10,.1)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>x = seq(0.1, 10, 0.1)
</code></pre>

<p>(You may ask: what the heck is the difference?! In this case, you don't need the <strong>formatR</strong> package because you are not <strong>picky</strong> enough...)</p>

<p>At the same time, I also removed the function <code>tidy.source()</code> from the <strong>animation</strong> package. Since this was my first R package, I tended to put everything into a single package, including some functions which are apparently irrelevant. I put them there just for my own use. Now all of them are defunct; see <code>?'animation-defunct'</code> in the next version of the <strong>animation</strong> package.</p>
