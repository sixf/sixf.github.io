<p>Here is my personal list of rules of thumb for people who want to meet some R gurus (quickly) in the R help mailing list (<code>R-help@R-project.org</code>):</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to meet Dr <strong>Bill Venables</strong>, just say something about <strong>Type III Sum of Squares</strong> (better if you also mention the ``unbeatable'' <strong>SAS</strong>);</li>
<li>If you want to meet Prof <strong>Douglas Bates</strong>, say something about <strong>LSMEANS</strong> (of course, with SAS) and P-values for the fixed effects in <code>lmer()</code> (or wait in the mixed-models group <code>r-sig-mixed-models@r-project.org</code> -- he often shows up there);</li>
<li>If you want to meet Prof <strong>Frank Harrell</strong> Jr, say SAS is unbeatable (or efficient, golden-standard, high-quality graphics, whatever);</li>
<li>If you want to meet Dr <strong>Martin Maechler</strong>, say something like "I need help on a <strong>library</strong> called <code>***</code>" (it is said that he would show up in 5 mins upon such mistakes, but I feel he is tired of correcting people who don't know the difference between a <strong>package</strong> and a <strong>library</strong> now);</li>
<li>If you want to meet Prof <strong>Brian Ripley</strong> (<a href="/en/2009/10/50000-revisions-committed-to-r/">the-professor-on-whom-the-sun-never-sets</a>), well, I guess you can say anything, because he is so devoted to the mailing list that you can see him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_everywhere">a.e.</a>, but you have to be careful enough not to be "Ripleyed";</li>
</ul>


<p>I've been reading the mailing list for about 2 years, so I may not know enough about all the gurus. Let me know if I missed anyone. The above list is not given for serious purpose, and my real point is I learned a lot from their advice and arguments.</p>
