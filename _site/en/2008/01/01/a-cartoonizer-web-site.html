<p>Here is a web site which can "cartoonize" your photos: <a href="http://www.befunky.com">http://www.befunky.com</a></p>

<p>I made a new year card with the help of this site as well as <code>Fireworks</code> and <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a>. As I have more than 1600 people in my contact list, Gmail forbade me from sending emails after I sent my new year's greeting to about 900 people... -_-//</p>
