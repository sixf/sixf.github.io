<p>I finished reading this document just now. In fact, it seems to be the first R document I have ever <em>finished</em> reading:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>“Using R for Data Analysis and Graphics - Introduction, Examples and Commentary”</strong> by John Maindonald (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/usingR-2.pdf">PDF</a>, data sets and scripts are available at <a href="http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/%7Ejohnm/">JM's homepage</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>I think there were some places which need slight modifications, for instance, the code "<code>&gt; x_c(1,5,NA,8)</code>" on Page 17: the assignment operator "_" is not for R now (only for S-Plus), etc.</p>

<p>In all, this document is good for R novices especially in R basics such as data structures and functions (to obtain an overview of R language), and other parts are quite rough, among which the part for linear models and ANOVA is relatively comprehensive, and other parts such as GLM, tree-based models, time series, linear mixed effect models and multi-level models are not discussed in details.</p>

<p>Besides, the title for this document contains "Graphics", but I think those blurry bitmaps in the text are not satisfactory at all...</p>
