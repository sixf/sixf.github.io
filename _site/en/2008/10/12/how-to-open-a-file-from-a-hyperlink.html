<p>I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/friendly.html">Michael Friendly</a> for telling me this: just create a hyperlink to the file with the <code>run</code> protocol and then you can open a file directly from the hyperlink. For example, in LaTeX with the <strong>hyperref</strong> package, you may use <code>\href{run:path/to/some.file}{some link}</code> to open this <code>some.file</code> in your PDF. This is a useful hack that I have been looking for over a long time.</p>
