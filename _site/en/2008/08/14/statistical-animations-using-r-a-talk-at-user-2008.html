<p>As a few participants told me that they were interested in my animations and hoped to get a copy of my presentation, I have uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/animation-useR-2008-Yihui-Xie.ppt">slides</a> for you to download.</p>

<p>Don't forget to visit <a href="http://animation.yihui.name">http://animation.yihui.name</a> to find more animations. To know more about the package, please read the <a href="http://animation.yihui.name/animation:start">documentation page</a>. Feedbacks &amp; comments are especially welcome!</p>
