<p>There was something wrong with the wheel of my mouse these days: it could not control the scrolling of a page very well. Today I found a screwdriver and opened the mouse. Then I knew the reason: there was a lot of dirt beneath the cover!</p>

<p>However, obviously the dirt would not follow a <code>B(n, p = 0.5)</code> distribution. The two proportions of the dirt in front and back of the wheel were not equal -- there was much more dirt in the back. Why?</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glivenko-Cantelli_theorem">Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem</a> tells us that the empirical distribution converges to the true distribution almost surely.</p></blockquote>

<p>So what? The proportions of the dirt has revealed my habit of using the mouse, as I have used it for too many times. What I usually do is to scroll <em>down</em> a page, and rarely will I scroll <em>up</em> -- that is the real distribution, and the dirt in the mouse has recorded the empirical distribution day by day. If I am serious enough, I can get the numbers of the weight and estimate the parameter <em>p</em> in the Binomial distribution. (Perhaps <a href="http://bojan.3e.pl/weblog">Michal</a> will again suggest me do this. :grin: )</p>
