<p>I spent three days on these two plugins. The first one "<a href="http://animation.yihui.name/wiki:animation_plugin">animation</a>" is written by myself after a quick view of the instructions on writing plugins for Dokuwiki, as there is no such kind of plugins so far. What I want to say is "Regular expression is really a devil"! It has almost taken me a whole day to understand how to use a correct pattern to match the parameters in the tags...</p>

<p>Then I modified the "<a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/plugin:math">math</a>" plugin so that it is much easier and more familiar for us to type LaTeX formulae in the wiki pages: just use <code>$...$</code> or <code>$$...$$</code>. People who are familiar with LaTeX surely know what they mean.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://www.sciviews.org/_phgrosjean">Philippe Grosjean</a> has kindly provided me the necessary files for highlighting R code in the Dokuwiki system. That's really fantastic! See <a href="http://animation.yihui.name/wiki:math">this page</a> for some examples.</p>

<p>So the main infrastructure has been built till now; the next step is to modify my <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation"><strong>animation</strong></a> package and include more functions which have been in my mind for a long time. Then I will begin to migrate the old web pages to <a href="http://animation.yihui.name">AniWiki</a>.</p>
