<p>The <a href="http://www.swftools.org/">SWF Tools</a> has provided several SWF utilities for the manipulation and creation of Flash files. Today I just wrote a wrapper <code>saveSWF()</code> in the package <strong>animation</strong> to convert image frames to Flash animations. I'd like to thank <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley</a> for telling me this tool set. The function <code>saveSWF()</code> is to appear in <code>animation 1.0-1</code>.</p>

<p>Up to now, there are four kinds of animations in the animation package:</p>

<ol>
<li>animations inside R windows graphics devices;</li>
<li>animations in HTML pages (driven by JavaScript);</li>
<li>GIF or AVI animations with the help of "ImageMagic";</li>
<li>Flash animations with the help of "SWF Tools".</li>
</ol>
