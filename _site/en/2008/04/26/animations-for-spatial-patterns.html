<p>Sorry, it has been a long long time since I wrote the last blog entry... In the past few months, I was extremely busy with a lot of time-consuming affairs, and it seems that such a trend is not to change in near future.</p>

<p>A week ago, <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/ye_li/">Ye Li</a> wrote me an email, telling me his interests in my package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation">animation</a>. And his idea was to implement animations in spatio-temporal models to illustrate certain changes of patterns over time / space (say, clustering). Well, this sounds easy for me to create animations, however, I should know theories behind spatial statistics first of all -- that's much more difficult than the animation techniques and requires more efforts in study.</p>

<p>Here is a simple demonstration using the map of USA:</p>

<p>I just used the function <code>saveMovie()</code> in the <strong>animation</strong> package:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="r">library<span class="p">(</span>animation<span class="p">)</span>
library<span class="p">(</span>maps<span class="p">)</span>
saveGIF<span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="kr">for</span> <span class="p">(</span>i <span class="kr">in</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="m">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
    map<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;state&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> col <span class="o">=</span> sample<span class="p">(</span>terrain.colors<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">30</span><span class="p">)),</span> fill <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">TRUE</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">},</span> ani.height <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">300</span><span class="p">,</span> ani.width <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">500</span><span class="p">,</span> outdir <span class="o">=</span> getwd<span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Easy enough, huh?</p>
