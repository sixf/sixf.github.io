<p>I was unfortunately caught in the rain this evening and my glasses were blurred by the rain drops. When I came back the office, took them off and was about to clear the beads, I just found a good RNG (<em>Random Number Generator</em>) from the nature:</p>

<p>People who are familiar with statistical computation must have learned how to generate random numbers following a <code>U(0, 1)</code> distribution. One of the most common generators is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a>. This is just what I was reminded of by the rain drops on my glasses. The plot below is made in R based the linear congruential generator:</p>

<p>Do they look like each other? Here is a simple animation.</p>
