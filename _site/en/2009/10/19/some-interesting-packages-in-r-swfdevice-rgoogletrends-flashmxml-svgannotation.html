<p>I love R because there are always exciting new packages which can be far beyond your imagination. Here I'd like to introduce a couple of packages that look really awesome:</p>

<h1>1. swfDevice: R graphics device for SWF output (by Cameron Bracken)</h1>

<p>This package is still at a pre-alpha stage but you can see a sketch now in R-Forge: <a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/swfdevice/">https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/swfdevice/</a></p>

<p>Its author, Cameron, certainly knows well that I will be excited to see it, because I've been waiting for a long long time for the REAL Flash animation output in R. What I've done in my <code>animation</code> package is simply using SWF Tools to combine several static pictures (PNG or PDF, ...) into a naive Flash animation -- by "naive" I mean there is no interaction or real dynamic stuff in the Flash animation. Hopefully Cameron will provide a useful tool to create genuine Flash animations directly from R (with the help of the library <code>libming</code>).</p>

<p>By the way, I have to mention that the <code>tikzDevice</code> package by Cameron and another author is also fantastic for generating high-quality graphics LaTeX.</p>

<h1>2. RGoogleTrends: Query and download Google Trends data in R</h1>

<p>Ever heard of <a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a>? Duncan Temple Lang released an R package named <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGoogleTrends">RGoogleTrends</a> that allows you to download Google Trends data directly from R. Basically this package uses <code>RCurl</code> to log in your Google account and send queries to get Google Trends data. Well, you may ask "why bother using a package since I can manually download the data by myself?"; just imagine R can automatically and dynamically do it for you, so you don't have to open the web page every day.</p>

<h1>3. FlashMXML and SVGAnnotation: New graphics devices for R</h1>

<p>They are also written by Duncan Temple Lang. <code>FlashMXML</code> can record R graphics in MXML (a kind of XML language) and we can compile the XML file to Flash output. <code>SVGAnnotation</code> enables us to save R graphics in SVG format, which also supports animation. The function <code>animate()</code> will be of great help to my <code>animation</code> package, I think.</p>
