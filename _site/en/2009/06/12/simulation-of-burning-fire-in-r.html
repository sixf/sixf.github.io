<p>Linlin Yan posted <a href="http://cos.name/en/topic/the-first-r-code-here">a cool (hot?) simulation of burning fire</a> with R in the <a href="http://cos.name/en/">COS forum</a> yesterday, which was indeed a <em>warm</em> welcome. I'm not sure whether our forum members will be scared by the "fire" under the title "Welcome to COS Forum". The fire was mainly created by the function <code>image()</code> with carefully designed rows and columns in heated colors <code>heat.colors()</code>. Here is one of the pictures generated from his code:</p>

<p>The speed of drawing animation frames is rather slow in my computer, but it doesn't matter since we can use the <strong>animation</strong> package (hey, you are advertising!) to save all the image frames and convert them to a single animation file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="r">library<span class="p">(</span>animation<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># set row=50 instead of the default 100 to let the fire burn to the ceiling</span>
<span class="c1"># make sure you have installed the SWF Tools and the command &#39;png2swf&#39; can</span>
<span class="c1">#    be executed (with or w/o it installation path); see ?saveSWF</span>
saveSWF<span class="p">(</span>Fire<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">50</span><span class="p">),</span> interval <span class="o">=</span> <span class="m">0.05</span><span class="p">,</span> dev <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;png&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> outdir <span class="o">=</span> getwd<span class="p">(),</span>
    para <span class="o">=</span> list<span class="p">(</span>mar <span class="o">=</span> c<span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Now the animation is much more smooth than what we saw in R graphics window.</p>

<p>Thanks, awesome Linlin.</p>
