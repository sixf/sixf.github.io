<p>I'm attending a workshop on reproducibility at <a href="http://icerm.brown.edu/tw12-5-rcem">ICERM</a> (Brown University) this week. I really appreciate this great opportunity offered by ICERM, <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/">Randy</a> and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/">Victoria</a>.</p>

<p>It is pretty exciting to meet people that you only knew before through indirect ways. One coincidence was that I met <a href="http://fperez.org">Fernando</a> here (for the first time)! We did not know each other before I wrote the <a href="/en/2012/11/ipython-vs-knitr/">IPython post</a> back in November, and I did not expect that we would meet each other so soon. Anyway, it is great to see this extremely energetic guy in person. Nerdy as I am, I immediately asked him (did I even say hello?) how IPython saves and displays plots, and he quickly showed me on the whiteboard.</p>

<p>Some simple notes as bullet points:</p>

<ul>
<li>One big question about reproducible research is, <em>where is the reward system</em>? e.g. why should young researchers spend more time on making papers reproducible instead of publishing more papers? There seems to be no immediate reward (although some <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/112929796403983408632/posts/3Ts7zpmnQ8T">argue</a> that papers with data/code available have higher citation rates)</li>
<li>You should look at the Fortran code blackened out in <a href="http://icerm.brown.edu/materials/Slides/tw-12-5/What_does_it_take_to_do_reproducible_computational_science%3F_What_stands_in_our_way%3F_%5D_Bill_Rider,_Sandia_National_Laboratories.pdf">Bill Rider's slides</a>; it is not that people do not want to share...</li>
<li>Victoria has a nice <a href="http://icerm.brown.edu/materials/Slides/tw-12-5/A_brief_history_of_the_reproducibility_movement_%5D_Victoria_Stodden,_Columbia_University.pdf">historical review</a> of reproducible research</li>
<li>I learned <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/">MacTutor</a> from Jon Borwein's talk, which seems to be a good old website like Wikipedia (for Math)</li>
<li>I enjoyed the talk by David Donoho most; they wrote a paper "Deterministic Matrices Matching the Phase Transitions of Gaussian Random Matrices", and what is truly amazing is that this paper was done through "crowd sourcing"; guess who is the "crowd"? His Stat330/CME362 students (as well as the TA)! They used Dropbox, GIT, <a href="http://www.runmycode.org/CompanionSite/site.do?siteId=190">runmycode</a> and clusters. The three big points:

<ul>
<li>Math as science: mathmaticians should learn science and scientific publication (emphasis on publishing empirical results)</li>
<li>Research as teaching: teaching can be turned into research; see the above paper</li>
<li>Code development as science: I especially resonate with this point -- code development actually has mature models and practices for a long time, which should be the ideal (or standard) paradigm of doing science; it is rare to see an open source software package published with one single final version; instead we often see versions (version control and semantic versioning) which mark the progress of the package, and we have a full history of how it was written, but papers almost always only have one version</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I learned <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/">HOL light</a> from Tom Hales' talk, which is a computer program for proving theorems (does it help me write my PhD thesis?)</li>
<li>David Bailey talked about <a href="http://icerm.brown.edu/materials/Slides/tw-12-5/High-Precision_Computation_and_Reproducibility_%5D_David_Bailey,_Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory.pdf">High-Precision Computation and Reproducibility</a>; I'm not familiar with this area but the talk is very interesting, e.g. a change in the float-point library can lead to different observations of particles in physics (some particles might have "gone" after you replace the library); I did not realize numeric precision has such a profound influence</li>
</ul>

<p>BTW, to follow up David's crowd sourcing, my advisor Di Cook did something similar earlier this year but less seriously: the students who took Stat585 at Iowa State collaborated on Github for <a href="https://github.com/dicook/stat585">a fiction in statistics</a> when we were learning GIT in that class, which was actually a lot of fun...</p>
