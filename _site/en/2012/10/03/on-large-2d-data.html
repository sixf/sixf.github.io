<p>Two months ago I was told <a href="/en/2008/09/to-see-a-circle-in-a-pile-of-sand/">one of</a> my old blog posts was borrowed to this post: <a href="http://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/2012/07/27/finding-patterns-in-big-data-with-sasgraph/">Finding patterns in big data with SAS/GRAPH</a>. I wrote <a href="/en/2008/09/to-see-a-circle-in-a-pile-of-sand/">my blog post</a> four years ago just for fun. The over-plotting issue is pretty boring to me now, but what caught my attention were:</p>

<ol>
<li>alpha-transparency was a new feature in SAS 9.3 (I found this hard to believe);</li>
<li>the SAS code was so much longer (not surprising to me);</li>
</ol>


<p>Well, I do not care and do not intend to start the boring war. If I were to write that post again, I would add the hexagon plot as yet another alternative.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="r">library<span class="p">(</span>hexbin<span class="p">)</span>
with<span class="p">(</span>x<span class="p">,</span> plot<span class="p">(</span>hexbin<span class="p">(</span>V1<span class="p">,</span> V2<span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Two personal announcements:</p>

<ol>
<li>I'll be attending the Infovis Week at Seattle from Oct 14 to 17;</li>
<li>I'll pay a visit to the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins from Oct 23 to 24;</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm happy to meet people nearby during these days. My Seattle schedule is pretty much empty; just let me know.</p>
