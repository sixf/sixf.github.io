<p>Karthik Ram gave an <a href="http://inundata.org/R_talks/meetup/">Introduction to R</a> a couple of weeks ago, and I strongly recommend you to take a look at his cool HTML5 slides. I started <a href="/slides/2011-r-dev-lessons.html">trying HTML5 slides</a> last year, and now it is difficult for me to go back to beamer, which I have used for a few years for my presenations. It is horrible to see beamer slides everywhere at academic conferences (especially the classic blue themes).</p>

<p>You probably have heard of an interesting blog post by Ben Schmidt about <a href="http://sappingattention.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/visualizing-ocean-shipping.html">ocean shipping animations</a> in the 18th and 19th centuries. I also played with the dataset a little bit, and made some slides named <a href="/slides/stat585x-shipping-yihui-xie.html">Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor</a> (use Left/Right or Up/Down to navigate). The source file was written in markdown, compiled by <a href="/knitr/"><strong>knitr</strong></a>, then converted to DZSlides by <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>.</p>

<p>I'm using the development version of <strong>knitr</strong>, which you can install from <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/#readme">Github</a>. I plan to release the version 0.5 this weekend, and this version will particularly feature the markdown support. You can always read the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/NEWS">NEWS</a> file to know what is going on in the development.</p>

<p>Another piece of news which may be a little bit early to announce is the corresponding support in RStudio. I'm not going to say any details about it right now, but I'm pretty sure the so-called reproducible research and dynamic report generation can be easier than ever very soon! No LaTeX. No worries about HTML/CSS. A simple text file and a single click will give your a reasonably beautiful HTML page. Stay tuned.</p>
